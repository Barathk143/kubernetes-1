# This playbook sets up a minimal installation with replication. As such it needs
# at least three servers with all device types enabled.
# It does not setup authentication and must therefore be run in a trusted environment.
#
# Each line names one host along with variables in the format key=value
# Supported variables are:
# - bootstrap_device=<device path>
# - dir_device=<device path>
# - metadata_device=<device path>
# - data_device=<device path>
#
# For demo set-ups on machines (or VMs) with a single drive, use the test_devices=yes
# parameter. This will create three bind mounts on the machine at /test_dev_{d,r,m}
# which can be used for the variables configuring device paths.
#
# After running the playbook, you can reach the webconsole at:
# http://server1:8080
# 
# qmgmt can be executed on any machine that can connect to server1 with:
# qmgmt -u http://server1 ...
#
# Volumes can be mounted with the following command:
# mount.quobyte server1,server2,server3/<volumename> ~/mymountpoint

[machines]
# Minimal example:
# server1 bootstrap_device=/mnt/data0 metadata_device=/mnt/data1 data_device=/mnt/data2
# server2 registry_device=/mnt/data0 metadata_device=/mnt/data1 data_device=/mnt/data2
# server3 registry_device=/mnt/data0 metadata_device=/mnt/data1 data_device=/mnt/data2

[machines:vars]
## Repository URL for your distribution, for example:
repository=https://support.quobyte.com/repo/1/<INSERT REPO KEY HERE>/xUbuntu_14.04
## Repeat all servers that have bootstrap_device or registry_device set, for example:
registry_server=server1:50001,server2:50001,server3:50001
